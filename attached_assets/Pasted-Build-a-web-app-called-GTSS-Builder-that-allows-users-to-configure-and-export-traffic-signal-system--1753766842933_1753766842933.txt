Build a web app called GTSS Builder that allows users to configure and export traffic signal system data in a GTFS-like format (GTSS = General Traffic Signal Specification).
💻 Frontend:
Use React (with Vite or Next.js) or Vue 3 for the frontend.


Display a tabbed or side navigation layout with the following sections:


Agency Info


Signal Locations


Phases


Detectors


Preview & Export


Each section should include a table-style editor to input rows of data and add/delete/update entries.


Use local state or Pinia/Vuex/Redux as needed to manage form inputs and relationships between signals, phases, and detectors.


📦 Backend:
Use a simple Express.js (or Python Flask/FastAPI) server to:


Accept a POST request containing all GTSS data.


Convert each table (Agency, Signals, Phases, Detection) into a CSV file.


Package all CSVs into a .zip file.


Send it back for user download.


📁 Data Schema:
agency.txt
Fields: AgencyID, Agency_Name, Agency_URL, Agency_timezone, Agency_Language, contact_person, contact_email


signals.txt
Fields: SignalID, AgencyID, Street_Name1, Street_Name2, Cnt_lat, Cnt_lon, Control_Type, Cabinet_Type, Cabinet_Lat, Cabinet_Lon, has_BatteryBackup, has_CCTV


phases.txt
Fields: Phase, SignalID, Movement_Type, is_pedestrian, is_overlap, channel_output, Compass_Bearing, Posted_Speed_Limit, vehicle_detection_ids, ped_audible_enabled


detection.txt
Fields: SignalID, Detector_Channel, Phase, Description, Purpose, Vehicle_Type, Lane, Det_Technology_Type, Length, Stopbar_Setback


🧰 Requirements:
Allow the user to add multiple signals and link them to phases and detectors.


Validate required fields before export.


Optional: Support saving/loading the GTSS configuration to local storage or JSON.


Optional: Use Leaflet or Mapbox to visually place signals and cabinets on a map.


🎁 Export:
On clicking "Export", bundle all files into a ZIP and trigger a download in the browser.


Each file should follow the naming convention: agency.txt, signals.txt, phases.txt, detection.txt
